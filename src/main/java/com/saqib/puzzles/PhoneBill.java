/**
 * 
 * Codility test. This question, or some variant thereof, is one of the stock questions in the Codility test suite.
 * 
 *  Given a phone calls log in the form of a string with each record separated by \n (ascii code 10) calculate the total phone bill.
 *  Each record is correctly formed as "HH:MM:SS,nnn-nnn-nnn" e.g. "00:01:07,400-234-090" refers to a phone call to phone number 
 *  400-234-090 and lasted a duration of 1 minute and 7 seconds.
 *  Rules for calculating charges:
 *		   (i) For a phone call less than 5 minutes long charge 3 cents per second
 *		   (ii) For a phone call 5 minutes and longer charge 150 cents per started minute, so for a call of 5 minutes 2 seconds would be
 *		        charged as a 6 minute call i.e. 6 * 150 = 900 cents
 *		   (iii) All calls to the phone number with the longest total call duration are free. In the event that two phone numbers have the same total call duration use the one
